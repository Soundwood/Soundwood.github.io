Quite simply, I was let go from my manufacturing career as a result of the recent COVID events. While I am sure that many are in the same boat, I have a serious doubt that my role will ever return. I am also very bearish on manufacturing in general within the US. Though there are talks of significant reshoring I find it unlikely that this will take place except in the most critical industries (eg healthcare and infrastructure). 

While at my previous role I had been the primary point of contact for almost all projects and concerns that had a hint of technology related to them. I had also dedicated some significant time to self teaching programming on Python and SQL. The loss of my position, while undesired, provided the necessary push to make the leap. I am hoping that I can leverage my knowledge of manufacturing combined with the new knowledge of software engineering to better position myself and my family in the future job market.
